# To-Do-list
Simple To-Do List built with HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript. Add, complete, filter, and delete tasks. LocalStorage powered!

A simple and functional to-do list app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks, just pure frontend skills!
This project allows users to add, complete, filter, and delete tasks, and it saves tasks in the browser using localStorage.

Features
- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Delete tasks
- Filter by All / Active / Completed
- Clear all completed tasks
- Save tasks using localStorage (persistent on refresh)


## Project Purpose  

This project is built to:
Practice DOM manipulation using vanilla JavaScript
Understand and implement event handling, dynamic rendering, and data storage
Learn how to structure and organize code in a small real-world app
Prepare for frontend developer interviews by explaining every step clearly

##  How It Works

Tasks are stored as objects in an array:
{ text: "Do laundry", completed: false }
All tasks are saved in localStorage
Event listeners track button clicks, checkbox changes, and filters
App dynamically updates the DOM and saves all changes to storage

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 (semantic)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, responsive design)
- JavaScript (ES6+, DOM, localStorage)
